Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮
An enhanced and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — now with a twist!
Forget boring ties — in this version, each player can only have 3 moves on the board at a time. When a player makes their 4th move, their oldest move disappears, giving the opponent a chance to strike back. This makes the game faster, more strategic, and always ends with a winner! 🏆
